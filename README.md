# Welcome

You came here to learn about the projects I’ve worked on and the code I’ve written, but you’ll notice this space is completely empty. The reason is that the code I write is stored in the Git repositories of the companies I work for, and I prefer to spend my free time outside of work with my loved ones and on personal interests. But don’t worry, I’m a dedicated committer!
